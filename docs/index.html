            I pursued my passion by studying Computer Science at Technical
            University of Mombasa, where I honed my skills in various
            programming languages and technologies. During my time at
            university, I participated in several hackathons and coding
            competitions, which helped me to develop a problem-solving mindset
            and the ability to work effectively under pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and
            staying updated with the latest trends in technology. I believe in
            continuous learning and always strive to improve my skills and
            knowledge. This project, the Bus Booking System, is a reflection of
            my dedication to delivering high-quality, user-centric solutions.
          </p>
